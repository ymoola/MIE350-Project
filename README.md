## Overview

Our team is dedicated to helping companies reduce their carbon footprint and promote a sustainable work environment. To achieve this goal, we are developing an Internal Company Ride-Share Web Application. This application facilitates ride-sharing among employees for their daily commutes to and from the office, reducing single-occupancy vehicles on the road, traffic congestion, and carbon emissions.

## Project Objectives

1. **Facilitate Ride-Sharing:** Create a user-friendly web application that allows employees to find and connect with colleagues who share similar commuting routes.

2. **Reduce Carbon Footprint:** Promote sustainable commuting practices by increasing carpooling within the organization, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

3. **Improve Employee Experience:** Enhance the daily commute experience for employees by providing a convenient and reliable ride-sharing platform.

4. **Optimize Resource Utilization:** Maximize the utilization of company vehicles by enabling employees to share rides efficiently.

5. **Ensure Data Privacy:** Implement robust security measures and data protection protocols to safeguard employee information and maintain privacy.

6. **Provide Networking Opportunities:** Give users a chance to meet new people within their company.

7. **Safe Commuting Alternative:** Provide employees with a safe and risk-free way to commute by restricting ride-sharing features internally.

## Key Features

- **User Registration and Profiles:** Employees can create and manage their profiles, including commute preferences, work hours, and vehicle details.

- **Ride Matching:** The application uses algorithms to match employees with compatible commuting routes and schedules.

- **Communication:** Built-in messaging and notification system to facilitate communication between ride-sharing partners.

- **Route Planning:** Integration with mapping services helps users plan efficient routes for their commutes.

- **Ride History:** Maintain a history of past rides, allowing users to track their environmental impact and commuting patterns.

- **Feedback and Ratings:** Employees can provide feedback and ratings for their ride-sharing experiences, promoting accountability and improving the quality of rides.

- **Privacy Controls:** Robust data privacy controls protect sensitive employee information.

- **Matching Playlists and Talking Points:** Matching riders' hobbies and playlists for a more enjoyable experience.

- **Protection and Safety:** Easy access to emergency contacts and 911 in case of need.
